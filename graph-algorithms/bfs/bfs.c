/**
   bfs.c

   Functions for running the BFS algorithm on graphs with vertices
   indexed from 0.

   Optimization notes: 
   - using a bit array for testing if a vertex was visited, instead of
   prev[vts[i]] == NR, in order to decrease cache misses did not result
   in a speed up in tests even when the index computation was performed
   with a right bit shift on 64-bit words.
